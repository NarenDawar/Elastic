Elastic: A Python-based / Pythonic Programming Language (interpreter based).

This project was based on/inspired by:

- CodePulse's Make Your Own Programming Language Tutorial(s)
- Ruslan's Blog: Let's Make A Simple Interpreter

This project was made for fun out of interest. The Parser and Interpreter bases were created by CodePulse,
but I modified different parts to my liking and changed some functionality. I also added a variety of functions and data types.

Built-In Functions:
- print(param): Simple print statement
